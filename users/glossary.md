# Terminology Used

**Account** — a user account stored in the system for his identification (authentication) and provision of access to his personal data and settings.  

**Block** — a special structure for recording a group of transactions in the Bitcoin system and similar ones. A block consists of a header and a list of transactions. The block header includes its own hash, the hash of the previous block, transaction hashes, and additional overhead information.  

**Blockchain** — a strictly structured database with certain rules for building chains of transactions and access to information that excludes data theft, fraud, violation of property rights, etc.  

**Cleos** (cli + eos = cleos) — a command line interface for interacting with the blockchain and for managing wallets.  

**Container** — an object created using a Docker image and containing all the necessary components for the operation of the application. The container is a secure platform for the operation of the application.  

**Daemon** — a program on Linux systems, launched by the system itself and running in the background without direct user interaction.  

**Docker** — software to automate the installation of the application in the virtualization environment at the operating system level. Provides installation of an application with all its environments and dependencies into a container that can be ported to any Linux system with cgroups support in the kernel, and also provides a container management environment.  

**Docker-compose** — command line tool for managing multiple Docker multi-container applications.  

**Docker-file** — a file containing instructions and parameters for creating a Docker image for specific tasks.  

**Docker image** — Docker platform template, available only by reading and used to create containers.  

**Genesis** (Greek genesis) - the beginning of the formation of any object or subject and the subsequent process of its development, which led to a certain state.  

**Keosd** (key + eos = keosd) — a component that securely stores EOSIO keys in wallets.  

**Key** — a string of characters (bit string) used by the cryptographic algorithm for encrypting and decrypting messages, setting and verifying a digital signature, as well as identification. Keys are symmetric (the same key is used for encryption and decryption) and asymmetric (public and private).  

**Node** — a separate (software) device that is connected to the blockchain network according to the client-server scheme. Nodes are active elements and form the basis of the blockchain network technology.  

**Nodeos** (node ​​+ eos = nodeos) — the basic daemon of the EOSIO node, which can be configured using plug-ins to start the node. Examples of use: block production, dedicated API endpoints, and local development.  

**Plugin** — a software component, made as a separate module and being an addition to the main program.  

**Private key** — a code string with which you can access your wallet or bitcoin address. Required for transactions.  

**Public key** — a code string to which there is open access. Used along with the private key to send transactions. The public key corresponds to a bitcoin address.  

**P2P** (Peer to Peer) — a peer-to-peer computer network in which all participants (nodes) are equal in rights and can interact with each other, being a client and server simultaneously.  

**Validator** — a blockchain user who checks transactions for validity and signs them. Using its (leased) equipment, it ensures the functioning of the Nodes of the network, creates and signs new blocks, ensuring the safety of the network.  

**Wallet** — a software application that allows you to make a transaction from a given address and view its balance.
