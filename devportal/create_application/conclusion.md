# 9 Conclusion  

The Golos Core development team hopes that getting familiar with the instructions provided in this guide enables the developers to master the skills of creating and delpoying a decentralized application based on smart contracts.  

Unlike EOS, the smart-contracts built on CyberWay allows the developers not only to write and store information in the DBMS-tables, but also extract it from there using the API-query. The service provided by CyberWay platform provides reliable protection of user data. In the event of a breakdown of one or several nodes of the blockchain, CyberWay service will be deployed in another cloud space. In this case, the state of the failed node will be restored and synchronized, which guarantees the safety of user data.
