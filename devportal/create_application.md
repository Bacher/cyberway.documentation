# Guide to Creating and Deploying an Application on CyberWay 

This guide is intended to target the developers of smart contracts on CyberWay platform, as well as those who are interested in development using blockchain.  
The guide provides step-by-step instructions for creating and establishing a decentralized application on smart contracts for CyberWay blockchain. The guide also contains several instructions for implementing the most important software components including the smart contracts. A part of the instructions is inherited from the [EOS](https://developers.eos.io/eosio-home/docs/) blockchain documentation. 
 
The body of the manual may be adjusted within the process of development of CyberWay platform.
